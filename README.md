# Java-Console-Application
# Overview

The **ATM Project** is a fully functional simulation of an Automated Teller Machine, built with Java programming language. This project aims to replicate the core functionalities of an ATM system, offering an intuitive and secure interface for handling common banking operations.

- **Learning and Demonstration of OOP Principles**:  The project is designed to demonstrate essential object-oriented programming (OOP) principles like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- 
- **Real-world Financial Transactions**: It simulates real-world banking tasks like balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, and deposit, offering a realistic user experience.
- 
- **User Authentication**: Ensures that only authorized users can perform actions on the system by implementing secure login features.
## Features
The ATM System includes the following features:
- **Balance Inquiry**: View the current account balance.
- **Withdraw Funds**: Secure withdrawal of funds from the ATM.
- **Deposit Funds**: Add money to the account.
- **Change PIN**: Update your personal identification number.
- **Transaction History**: View a log of recent transactions.
